For most applications, websites can run with only client side code and be comprised of only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Such websites are usually defined as static websites. With no server side code to run or maintain there is no point in using conventional web servers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers multiple options for hosting static or dynamic websites. For static content, the simplest and most affordable option is the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
